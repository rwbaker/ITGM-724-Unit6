# Exercise 2: Guestbook
**Due Unit 6, ITGM 727**


### Learning Outcome
After completing this exercise, students will be able to use PHP script to successfully:

* create a simple guestbook Web page with embedded PHP
* utilize PHP variables and operators in the Web page
* call a PHP file using an HTML form.

### Procedure
Using the materials covered in the course so far, create a guestbook that allows users to leave comments. For extra credit, allow users to also upload an image with their post (up to 10 points awarded for this functioning feature).

1. Create a simple Web-based guestbook. Within the guestbook, create a one-part form that:
    * displays existing guestbook entries and the form for making new guest entries
    * collects the following information from the user:
        * guest name
        * e-mail address
        * guestbook entry
        * image attachment (for extra credit)
    * is validated to ensure that none of the fields are empty.
2. You are at liberty to determine the layout of your guestbook.
3. The data for the guestbook should:
    * be stored into a text file
    * include:
        * date
        * time
        * guest name
        * e-mail address
        * guestbook entry
4. Use appropriate variable names for your form fields.
5. Use the most appropriate file-access statements to connect to the file and store the results.
6. Use the necessary loop statements to display the guestbook.
7. Demonstrate use of at least one function.
8. Comment your code appropriately.

### Submission and Due Dates
Upload your working project to the designated space on the SFDM site, following the instructions provided by your instructor via an announcement. Before submitting, ensure that the site is functional.

1. Save the PHP files containing your source code in a folder named firstinitiallastname_ex2 (for example, Jane Doe would name her folder jdoe_ex2). This folder should also contain your image folder, if you chose to use the image feature.
2. Before submitting, compress your folder as a ZIP archive. Due to its large size, this folder must be zipped in order to submit.
3. By 11:59 p.m. U.S. EST/EDT on Day 7 of Unit 6, submit the following via the Submissions link in the course menu:
    * the URL to your Web page (included in the body of the submission)
    * the zipped folder with your documentation (attached to the submission).

### Grading
Exercise 2 is worth 20 percent of your overall grade in this course. Your work for this exercise will be graded according to the criteria specified in the Grading Rubric for Exercise 2 (PDF, 242 KB).
